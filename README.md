# Spring Security plugin for Stormpath #

The `stormpath-spring-security` plugin allows a [Spring Security](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/)-enabled application to use the [Stormpath](http://www.stormpath.com) User Management & Authentication API for all authentication and access control needs.

Stormpath is a User Management API that reduces development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Stormpath's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

Pairing Spring Security with Stormpath gives you a full application security system complete with immediate user account support, authentication, account registration and password reset workflows, password security and more -
with little to no coding on your part.
